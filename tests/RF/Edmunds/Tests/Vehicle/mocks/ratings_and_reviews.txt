        "title": "My engine is gone!!! fabric defect very Sad",
        "text": "I have an Audi A4 (VIN: WAUAFAFL9DA143522 / IEN913) bought on April 25, 2013. Recently, I took the car to the service area due to the fact that it was vibrating vigorously while driving. The diagnosis was that a piston was broken and a whole engine replacement was required. In conversation with my service advisor,he informs me that etiology of the damage is related to a factory defect. The car has a current mileage of 21,997 and I have been most responsible with the recommended service schedule, including oil and filter changes.\n\nThe car has been going through many issues since I bought. I left it in the service area, with the keys, I didn't wanted again!!! \n",

        "text": "Drove 75 miles to get car we wanted.\nReplaced wife's 2006 Saab 9-3 Sportcombi; would have bought another Saab 9-3 if company hadn't gone belly up.\nPremium Plus is a well damped firm/rough ride over potmarked New England backroads; highway ride is excellent.\nNot a big fan of the electronic steering at highway speeds; poor feedback through steering wheel.\nWife drives the car and gets 23-24 mpg; I drive and get 28-29 mpg. On the all highway drive home from dealership, trip computer showed 31.7 mpg with cruise at 75 mph; mpg ranges above are using miles driven/gallons to fill tank calculation.\nIf we could afford a Q5 TDI, would get that for the wife, and take the A4 for myself.\n",

        "suggestedImprovements": "Seeing that fold down rear seats can now be had in the \"Cold Weather\" package with Premium for 2014; also Xenon headlights in the S-Line package for Premium.\nThere is no oil dipstick; there's a plug in the top of the dipstick tube.\nDealership oil changes are done through the dipstick tube using\na vacuum device.\nAn electronic readout of the oil level tells you just that, the level.\nCall me old school, but a dipstick allows you to see, and smell the oil. If a head gasket blows, you'll see white blobs/streaks in the oil from leaking coolant.\nVW sells a dipstick, part # 06J115611E, that fits; calibrate the stick by noting where the oil level is when the MMI shows oil level as full.

        "suggestedImprovements": "The sound system on the A4 is a joke for a car of this quality and price.\nI had the base system on my old 2003 A4, which was also disappointing -- so I had high hopes when I sprung for the Bang & Olufsen system on the 2013.\nMajor letdown.\nThe highs are relatively clear, but the sound is thin and lacking in depth at the low to mid ranges.\nI listen to a lot of classical music, and it has absolutely no life when you listen to it in this car.\nSave your money and spend it on aftermarket upgrades if you are an audiophile of any kind.\nBMW and Mercedes are embarrassing Audi in this category.",

        "text": "After buying a 2013 VW Passat TDI in October for myself, it was my wife's turn for a new car. She had her heart set on a BMW 328i...until she got in one. Too small, too confining, truly baffling ergonomics. We then looked at another Passat TDI(too big), a Jetta TDI(too sparse), a Volvo S80(too something), and finally the Audi A4. We were both sold on it right away due to the Quattro and Nav systems. We immediately put 3,000 miles on it in the first week with a trip to Washington State. Handled perfectly on wet, icy and snowy roads, and was a really comfortable ride. No sign at all of the oil burning issue others have had after 3k miles, so hopefully that's a good sign.",

        "text": "This is my second Audi. I upgraded from a 2012 Audi A4 2.0T FWD with CVT. It was a great car. Great performance and gas mileage.\nHowever, I had an opportunity to upgrade to a quattro with the light package and 2013 upgrades. So far, the car is awesome. Drives even better with the Quattro and suspension and steering upgrades. And those lights, beautiful. The car is even more stricking then my 2012. I also like the 8 speed auto better then the CVT.",
        "favoriteFeatures": "Love the Quattro. It feels so planted. I also love the LED light package. And it's a great design for a\nsedan;better then both the BMW and Mercedes. Neither can beat the interior design and it's fit and finish. Great gas mileage too. Oh, and that turbo, so much fun to drive.\nGreat all around car.",

        "text": "Traded an '11 Acura TSX for this 2013 A4 Premium Plus and so glad I did!!\nCould not get comfortable in the Acura, and too little rear seat room for the family.\nThis Audi is \"right sized\" for a family of 4.\nPlenty of useable trunk space.\nRide is composed but comfortable, 18 inch wheels help the car stick around corners, powerful brakes to haul the car down from speed which it gains easily from the 2.0 turbo running through 8 gears.\nExcellent fit and finish and an attractive sedan from any angle in my opinion.\nElectric power steering gives up some feel, but is far superior to that found in the Acura. I\ncompared with BMW 3, Mercedes C class, Infiniti, and new Lexus ES.\nA4 was superior!",
        "favoriteFeatures": "Interior quality, fit and finish.\nAlso love the clarity of\nthe gauges, interior and exterior lighting, especially the LED light tubes in the headlights and taillights which are new for 2013.\nGas mileage has been a plus (getting 29-33 highway running at 75-80 mph and 25-28 around town).\nVery easy to find a comfortable driving position in this car.\nMMI interface is actually fairly intuitive to use, blue tooth works well, Nav screen has excellent graphics, and can use the car as a WiFi Hot Spot--excellent for the kids electronics when traveling.",
        "suggestedImprovements": "HVAC controls are a bit more complicated than they need to be but are learned farily easily with a bit of practice; would prefer a true tire pressure monitoring system that displays tire pressures individually (Audi's is an indirect system relying on hub sensors to detect differences in speed and hence potential pressure differences). A real dipstick in the engine to check the oil would be nice--the only way to check oil level is through a gauge in the MMI nav display.\nThat's about it and those are small complaints.",
