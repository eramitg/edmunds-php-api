I have a \u002702 \r\nAccord EX Coupe (only 4cyl), which \r\ncould be faster, but thats what \r\nperformance intakes and exhaust systems \r\nare for. Its extremely comfortable and \r\nrides very smooth. Gas mileage is good, \r\nwhich helps me with the amount of miles \r\nI put on it. The car is good looking, \r\nwhich will turn heads once I finish \r\nwith the work I am doing to it. Bottom \r\nline...this car will run forever if you \r\ntake car of it and is one of the most \r\nreliable cars out there. Resale value \r\nis also excellent."
