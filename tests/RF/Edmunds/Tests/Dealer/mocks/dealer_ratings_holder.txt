        "title": "Horrible Experience. Blatantly Cheated",
        "reviewBody": "I just wanted to say that I had a very bad experience with your service department.  I brought in a 20% off coupon, and in fact it was even advertised on your televisions, yet I received a paltry $177.83 discount.  The original amount prior to discount was $2,940.48, meaning I should have paid $588 less.  Therefore, I was cheated by $411.  When called about my $2,760 bill, the customer service person even had the nerve to say as the first thing out of his mouth when I answered the phone \"it\u0027s your lucky day,\" and then when asked why is that lucky he said \"because the parts are all in stock.\"   Unbelievable. \r\n\r\nEven though I stressed that I had a coupon before write up, and then on the phone before I picked up the car, I felt ignored.  The client service person even had the nerve to say that I had brought in a 15% coupon, which is ridiculous.  \r\nThe 20% coupon was sent to my home address, plus it is on the website and was advertised on the televisions that day.  This is a very easy case to prove to authorities.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked about the price on the phone that I was quoted and a discount, the service provider changed the subject by saying it was expensive because the starter for the car was also broken and that it would be replaced.  The starter was not touched, nor repaired, nor on the receipt.  Another blatant lie just to get me off the phone and not apply the discount.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I took my car in on a Saturday night.  As of Monday night, no call on the status.  Fine.  I called, left a message.  I was called later saying the car would be done tomorrow.  So Tuesday comes, no call.  I call again on Wednesday, and am then told that my car would be ready on Thursday evening.  Of course, the provider was not at work when I arrived, and so i was left with a ridiculous bill that had no 20% discount.  I\u0027m forced to pay for it to get the car back.  \r\n\r\nNot only was I cheated on that day, this dealership lost a customer for life, and I will relay the facts to others via social media.",
